## Learn the basic
    Make a research and understanding what is process and thread in window operating system
    Read my research in [here](https://hackmd.io/@D4rUL1eb3rt/HJ3gvnlMC)
## Hand On
    Ex1: 
    Make a simple program that run "tasklist" comment two compulsory element is Image Name and PID
    Ex2: 
    Develop an application with functionality similar to the 'taskkill' command in Windows. Support two termination methods: terminate process by Image name or by ProcessID. Specify the termination method through parameters passed to the program.
    Ex3: 
    Write a program simulating a processing race among 3 threads:

    Thread 1: Count the number of words in file 1.txt.
    Thread 2: Count the number of files in the current directory.
    Thread 3: Count the number of threads in the 'explorer.exe' process.
    Display on the screen the order of the 3 threads based on their completion time.
    For example:
    Thread 2: First prize
    Thread 1: Second prize
    Thread 3: Third prize
